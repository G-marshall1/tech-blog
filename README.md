# tech-blog

## Description

I wanted to create an application so I can write a tech blog about the technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies I am using. This tech blog includes a login, a home page where you can add a title and content to your blog, a history that will display your blog post, and once you click on it it will show you the title, the content, and the date created.
